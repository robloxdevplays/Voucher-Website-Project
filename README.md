# Introduction
This is the first project I did on my own with a bit of mentorship and guidance and a ton of problem solving, debugging, and solution finding. It was filled with a lot of exploring of different HTML and CSS code and required a lot of research for my experience.

# Things I could have done better 

-> Used flexboxes instead of margin for the header
-> Reduced the use of margin
-> Reduced the lines of code by using advance properties
